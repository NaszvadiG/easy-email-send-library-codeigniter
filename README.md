# easy-email-send-library-codeigniter
I create this library to make easier sending template emails with codeigniter

1 - Copy files to respective folders (application/config, application/libraries)
2 - Follow the example in application/controllers/Example.php how to use the library
3 - Edit files in application/views/emails:
3.1 - Layout.php is the common file to all email templates like header and footer, which will be loaded for all emails templates
3.2 - test_email.php is an template example, which will be loaded inside Layout.php
